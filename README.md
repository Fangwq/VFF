# VFF
Variational Fourier Features for Gaussian Processes

By James Hensman, Nicolas Durrande and Arno Solin.

Code accompanies this JMLR paper: http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-579.html

### Install
VFF relies heavily on [GPflow](github.com/GPflow/GPflow). After installing GPflow, clone this repo and add the VFF directory to your PYTHONPATH. There are some examples in the `experiments` directory that replicate figures from the manuscript. 

Questions and comments are welcome via github issues on this repo.
